Ok, I have most of the tests passing for the ResearchItem #create action. The only tests that I'm struggling with are the ones that check if a method is being called. I'll figure that out and get back to you.

I wrote the 'flagged?' and 'flag_item!' methods along with their tests for the idea, quick_idea, and comment classes. I interpreted 'create the necessary interface for the view layer' to mean writing those methods and not building out any views.
